**This is my Personal Website** <br>
- I'm using Github to host since Github Pages is free- and it makes updating the website easy, as well as integrating it with Cloudflare. <br>
- A downside of the free service _is_ that all my code is public, but I was going to publicize the code anyway. <br>

_Thank you for taking the time to check this out!_
