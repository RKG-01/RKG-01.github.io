**This is my Personal Website** <br>
A quick heads up: The code is very messy. I'm still new to web dev, especially Javascript. I still need to clean up the HTML and useless CSS. Thanks for checking it out anyway! 
- I'm using Github to host since Github Pages is free- and it makes updating the website easy, as well as integrating it with Cloudflare. <br>
- A downside of the free service _is_ that all my code is public, but I was going to publicize the code anyway. <br>

_Thank you for taking the time to check this out!_
